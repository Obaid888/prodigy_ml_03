Dataset:
Used the LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of hand gesture images.
The dataset includes images of various hand gestures, providing a diverse range for training the model.

Preprocessing:
Images were resized to a uniform size and normalized to ensure consistency.
Data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping were applied to increase the diversity of the training data.

Model Architecture:
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
The model includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for down-sampling, and dense layers for classification.

Training:
The model was trained on the preprocessed images using a combination of training and validation sets to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Achieved impressive accuracy in recognizing and classifying hand gestures.

Application:
This model can be integrated into systems requiring gesture-based control, such as virtual reality, gaming, and human-computer interaction interfaces.

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in creating responsive and interactive systems. By accurately recognizing hand gestures, this model paves the way for more natural and intuitive ways to interact with technology.
